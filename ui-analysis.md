2. **To Location**: Input with placeholder "Airport/City" (element index 7)
3. **Departure Date**: Button showing "Departure11 Jul, 2025Friday" (element index 8)
4. **Return Date**: Button showing "ReturnBigger savings on return flight" (element index 9)
5. **Traveler/Class**: Shows "1 Traveller Economy" in the form

### Form Controls:

### Current Form State:
- From: "Dhaka" (DAC, Hazrat Shahjalal...)
- To: "Cox's Bazar" (CXB, Cox's Bazar...)
- Departure: "11 Jul, 2025 Friday"
- Traveller: "1 Traveller Economy"

### Key Observations:
1. The form uses specific input placeholders and button structures
2. Location inputs appear to have autocomplete functionality
3. Date selection uses button-based date picker
4. Traveler selection likely opens a modal/dropdown
5. The search functionality is prominently displayed

### Required Updates for Test:
- Need to update selectors to match actual HTML structure
- Location inputs use "Airport/City" placeholder
- Date selection is button-based, not input-based
- Traveler selection needs different approach



## Search Results Page Analysis
